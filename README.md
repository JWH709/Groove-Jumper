A music trivia game by John Heneghan

## How to Play

The user will be given an album and 20 seconds to find a connection between that album and another.  
The connection can be a contributing artist, a label, a style of music, or the year a record was released.  
Once a connection is found, the clock is reset, and the user can repeat this process until they run out of known connections.  
After the given 20 seconds runs out on a connection, the game ends, and a score is given based on how many connections a user made.

## Planned Features

- Search bar with an auto-complete feature to allow users to make connections as fast as possible
- Post-game record stack section where users can review the connections made in the previous game
- Game timer that resets every time a connection is made and ends the game once time runs out
- Score display box that displays the users current score as well as their overall high score during a session
